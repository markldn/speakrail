"""MicroSession: the live harness (the turn-taking LLM decides every turn-taking step, one token per input event).

Same transport and plumbing as cascade.Session (ASR websocket + turn head + fork peek, Breeze TTS, tape, events.jsonl,
the browser protocol); only the brain differs. The context is built with protocol.py, the ONE
definition shared with the tape builder, so the model sees exactly what it was trained on:

  inputs    live Voxtral words; <complete> by the turn head's endpoint rule (a new word arms it; 3 frames at >= 0.9 of
            P(complete)+P(backchannel) while we are silent, of P(complete) while we speak; never on a backchannel over our
            speech), preceded by the fork-peek's pending words; <user_bc> at a head P(backchannel) >= 0.95 onset;
            <sil:Ns> ladder (1, 2, 4 ... 256 s) after the last speech (the user's or our own playback) while nobody speaks.
  calls     serial: inputs that arrive while a call is in flight wait for it, then go in as one batch = one call.
            idle {speak, interrupt, listen, listen_muted}; overlap {continue, yield, listen}. vLLM completions API with
            allowed_token_ids; an optional per-decision logit bias (none by default).
  reply     speak / interrupt: streamed from the context (control tokens banned), clauses to TTS as they arrive;
            a web_search call is answered by SearXNG, the local tools (tools.py: notes, lists, todos, counter,
            stopwatch, Open-Meteo weather, unit_convert, calculator, dice, time) in process; the reply continues after.
  overlap   the user is heard while we speak: the reply is pinned at the word playing at the onset, the rest is not saved,
            an overlap turn opens; continue -> the reply is resumed (rest saved at its end), yield -> audio stops.
            Never before the reply has a word (input waits for the first one: no empty model turn).
  interrupt what the user said before they could hear us (our audio start + react_ms) is the tail of the turn we cut
            into and is dropped, its <complete> / <user_bc> too (the tape builder never shows it); what they say after
            that waits until our first sentence has played (hold_max_s at most) and only then opens the overlap.
  rules     barge_in "duck": duck the audio while the head hears the user over a reply (not an interrupt), the model
            still decides; + the safety net (MicroCfg.safety_yield_s). "word": the first non-backchannel word yields at once
            (no call); "head": also duck the audio while the
            head hears speech; "off": the model decides. Early start: a non-backchannel word while <= undo_words of our
            reply have played undoes the reply (context rolled back to before the speak call; the words join the turn).
  spec      on the first silent frame with P(fire) >= spec_tau (0.5) while we are silent: peek, fork the context with the
            peek's words + <complete>, decide on the fork and, on speak, generate the reply with its audio and text held
            (spec_parallel, 10-04 late: the reply is requested together with the decision and killed unless it is speak).
            The endpoint rule's commit adopts the fork if nothing arrived in between (held audio goes out at once);
            speech, a word the peek didn't have, or any other input discards it and the normal path runs.

Per session: sessions/<id>/{events.jsonl, turns.json, summary.json, words.jsonl, tape.wav} as cascade, plus
timeline.txt (inputs, calls, replies), calls.jsonl and context.txt (the rendered context).
